We study a mathematical model describing flows of electrorheological fluids. A theorem of existence of a weak solution is proved. For this purpose the approximating-topological method is used.

Introduction Electrorheological fluids are smart materials that are concentrated suspensions of polarizable particles in a nonconducting dielectric liquid. In moderately large electric fields the particles form chains along the field lines and these chains then aggregate into the form of columns. These chainlike and columnar structures yield dramatic changes in the rheological properties of the suspensions. The fluid becomes anisotropic, the apparent viscosity (the resistance to flow) in the direction, orthogonal to that of the electric field, abruptly increases, while the apparent viscosity in the direction of the electric field changes not so drastically. Let   Rn be a bounded domain, in which a fluid flows, n  {2, 3}. Let the boundary S of  be Lipschitz continuous. As it is well known, the stationary movement of any fluid is described by the equation in Cauchy form:

Definition 1.1. A couple of functions (u, p)  W × L2 () is a weak solution of problem (1.1)­(1.3), (1.8), (1.10), (1.12) if it satisfies equality (1.15) for all h  Z . The following conditions are imposed on the functions  and  . (C1) There are positive constants a1 and a2 such that a1

(C3) The function (·, y2 , ·) : R+ × [0, 1]  R is jointly continuous in ( y1 , y3 ) for all y 2  R+ . 2 (C4) The function y1  ( y1 , y2 , y3 ) y1 is not decreasing at nonnegative values of y1 .

(1.17)

(C6) The function  : R × R+  R is continuous. Note that conditions (C1)­(C6) have a physical meaning (see [2, 4]). The main result of this paper is the following theorem. Theorem 1.2. Suppose that conditions (C1)­(C6) are satisfied. Then there exists a weak solution of problems (1.1)­(1.3), (1.8), (1.10), (1.12). For the proof of Theorem 1.2 we use the approximating-topological method [8]. For this purpose, in the beginning, we determine an equivalent operational treatment of the problem under consideration. After that for the obtained operational equation, we introduce an approximating family of equations depending on a parameter  and by use of Skrypnik's version of the topological degree [7], on the basis of a priori estimates, we prove existence of solutions of the approximating equations. As a result, making limiting transition for   0, we obtain the solvability of problem (1.1)­(1.3), (1.8), (1.10), (1.12). 2. Operational treatment Let us introduce some notations. By X  we denote the space, conjugate to some Banach space X , g, y denotes the action of the functional g  X  on the element y  X , X m is the topological product of m copies of the space X . Determine several mappings as follows: A : Z - Z  ,

It is obvious that the set of weak solutions of problem (1.1)­(1.3), (1.8), (1.10), (1.12) coincides with the set of couples (u, p)  W × L2 () that satisfy the following operational equation: A(u) + K (u, p) + M (u) - D ( p) = F. 3. Properties of operators

R. H. W. Hoppe et al. 7 The last expression in inequality (3.8) tends to zero by conditions (C1)­(C3) and by the L Lebesgue theorem. emma 3.2. The operator K possesses the following properties. (1) For any sequence {uk , hk , pk } 1 from Z × Z × L2 ()n , for which (uk , hk , pk ) k=

k l

(u0 , h0 , p0 ), there is a subsequence {ukl , hkl , pkl } 1 such that K (ukl , pkl ), hkl - - - l=
K (u0 , p0 ), h0 (from this property, in particular, it follows that the operator K is

bounded and demicontinuous). (2) The operator K (·, T (·)) is compact for any operator T : Z  L2 (). Proof. (a) So, let the limits from the condition take place. Using the fact that the embedding Z L2 (S)n is compact, we take a subsequence {ukl , hkl } 1 such that l=

(b) We will use Gelfand's criterion, having reformulated it according to the following lemma. Lemma 3.3. The subset M of a separable Banach space is relatively compact, if from any sequence of functionals {fk } 1 belonging to  and such that k=
- fk ( y ) - - 0
k

y 

,

(3.14)

it is possible to take a subsequence {fkl } 1 such that (3.14) is valid for it uniformly for all y l= from M. The proof of Lemma 3.3 is similar to that of [3, Theorem 3(1.IX), page 274], minor changes are connected with transition to a subsequence in the formulation of the statement. Now, let T : Z  L2 () be an operator, let M be some bounded set from Z , and let hk 0 in the space (Z  )  Z . For all u from M we have

(3.15)

However, the embedding Z L2 (S)n is compact, therefore for some subsequence {hkl } 1 l= we obtain that hkl , K (u, T u) - - 0 uniformly for all u from M. Hence, the set K (M, - T (M)) is relatively compact as it was required to show. L emma 3.4. Let M ,  > 0, be an approximation of the operator M , that is M : Z - Z  ,

Now for sufficiently large l and small  we obtain the required estimate (4.4). 5 . Existence of a solution of the approximation equation For the proof of existence of a solution of the approximation equation we apply the method of topological degree for generalized monotonous maps (see [7]). We show that the family  carries out homotopy of the maps  and  . For this purpose, we will t 0 1 notice first that from the a priori estimate (4.4) it follows that there is a sphere of nonzero radius R, with the center at zero, such that on its boundary there are no solutions of the equation  (u ) = 0(t  [0, 1]). t

For our purpose it is necessary to prove first the following statements. (a) For any sequence {uk } 1 on the border of the sphere R , and for any sequence k= u0 in Z , k (uk ) {tk } 1 of points from the interval [0, 1] such that uk 0 t k=

(5.1)

holds. We will show that this inequality is not valid. From the hypothesis of statement (a) we have

Without loss of generality we may suppose that the subsequence {tkl } 1 is such that l= - tkl - - t0  [0, 1]. All operators, that we have determined, are bounded. Hence

At the same time, from the properties of the operator, that we have proved, it follows that from the sequence {ukl } 1 it is possible to take a subsequence {uklm }=1 such that m l=

holds. The first summand in equality (5.8) tends to zero since tk - - t0 , the second - summand tends to zero since all operators in (5.8) are demicontinuous. T hus, the maps  and  are homotopic, at the same time the degree deg ( , R , 0) is 0 1 0 an odd number, as  is an odd map. Therefore, the solutions of the equation  (u ) = 0 0 1 exist for sufficiently small  , as it was required to show. 6. Limiting transition
