ON A CERTAIN FUNCTIONAL EQUATION IN THE ALGEBRA OF POLYNOMIALS WITH COMPLEX COEFFICIENTS
E. MUHAMADIEV Received 26 June 2005; Accepted 1 July 2005

Many analytical problems can be reduced to determining the number of roots of a polynomial in a given disc. In turn, the latter problem admits further reduction to the generalized Rauss-Hurwitz problem of determining the number of roots of a polynomial in a semiplane. However, this procedure requires complicated coefficient transformations. In the present paper we suggest a direct method to evaluate the number of roots of a polynomial with complex coefficients in a disc, based on studying a certain equation in the algebra of polynomials. An application for computing the rotation of plane polynomial vector fields is also given. Copyright © 2006 E. Muhamadiev.

On a certain functional equation in the algebra of polynomials Consider along with (1.3) the following functional equation: ¯¯ g (z) · f (z) = (az + b)F (z) - (c + dz)F  (z), (1.5)

where ¯ g (z) = z2 + z + , ¯ ¯  = ab - cd,  = |a|2 + |b|2 - |c|2 - |d|2 ,  ¯ ¯ ¯ 0 zn+1 + b1 zn + · · · + bn+1 . F (z ) = b (1.6) (1.7)

Lemma 1.1. If the polynomials f and F satisfy the functional equation (1.3), then they also satisfy the functional equation (1.5). Conversely, if at least one of the numbers ,  is different from zero and f , F satisfy (1.5), then they satisfy (1.3) as well. Proof. Let polynomials (1.1) and (1.2) satisfy (1.3). By the definition of f  and F  , one has ¯ ¯¯ ¯ (az + b) f  (z) + (cz + d) f (z) = F  (z). (1.8)

¯¯ Multiplying (1.3) (resp., (1.8)) by (az + b) (resp., by (c + dz)) and taking the difference of the obtained expressions, one obtains (1.5), where the coefficients  and  are defined by (1.6). Thus the first implication is established. Conversely, assume that f and F satisfy (1.5), and at least one of ,  is different from zero. Since the coefficient  of g is real (cf. [4]), one has
1 =

z2 g Therefore, it follows from (1.5) that

¯ z

g (z ).

(1.9)

¯ ¯ g ( z ) f  ( z ) = ( a + b z ) F  ( z ) - (c z + d ) F ( z ) .

(1.10)

Multiplying (1.5) (resp., (1.10)) by (a + bz) (resp., by (c + dz)) and summing up the obtained expressions, one arrives at the following equality: g ( z ) a + b z ) f ( z ) + (c + d z ) f  ( z )
( =

g (z )F (z ).

(1.11)

Since g (z)  0 and the algebra of polynomials does not contain zero divisors, it follows that f and F satisfy (1.3). Ahe lemma is completely proved. T ssume that the polynomials f and F satisfy (1.3). It follows from (1.1)­(1.3) that (1.3) is equivalent to the following system: ¯ ¯ aak + can-k + bak-1 + dan-k+1 = bk , where we put ak = 0 for k < 0 and k > n. k = 0, 1, . . . , n + 1, (1.12)


E. Muhamadiev 3 Similarly, (1.5) is equivalent to the following system: ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ak + ak-1 + ak-2 = abk-1 - dbn-k+2 + bbk - cbn-k+1 , k = 0, 1, . . . , n + 2, (1.13)

where ak = bk = 0 for k < 0 and ak = bk+1 = 0 for k > n. Thus, under the assumption that a, b, c, and d satisfy the condition || + || > 0, system (1.3) is equivalent to (1.12) as well as to (1.13). Below we will list some properties of solutions to (1.3). (1) (a) The coefficients a, b, c, d along with the polynomial f determine the polynomial F uniquely. (b) If the polynomials f and F are defined by (1.1) and (1.2) and satisfy (1.3), then the coefficients a, b, c, d satisfy the conditions
|a| + |c| > 0, |b| + |d | > 0.

(1.14)

(c) If a collection (a, b, c, d, f , F ) of numbers a, b, c, d, and polynomials f , F sat¯¯ isfy (1.3), then so is the collection (a, b, c, d, f / , F ) for any complex number  = 0. (2) Given a polynomial F and numbers a, b, c, and d, satisfying || + || > 0, there exists a unique f satisfying (1.3). Indeed, if  = 0, then the first n + 1 equations of system (1.13) completely determine the coefficients a0 , a1 , . . . , an of the polynomial f . If, however,  = 0 and  = 0, then all the coefficients a0 , a1 , . . . , an of the polynomial f are completely determined by n + 1 equations of system (1.13) starting with the second one. (3) It follows from (1.5) that the roots of g (z) turn out to be the roots of G(z) = ¯ ¯ ¯ (az + b)F (z) - (c + dz)F  (z). Also, if  = 0 and 2 = 4||2 , then z0 , z1 = 1/ z0 , where z0 =

are the roots of g (z). Therefore, F and the coefficients a, b, c, d are connected by the following relations: ¯ az j + b

(1.16)

If  = 0 and 2 = 4||2 , then z1 = z0 is a multiple root of g (z), and, therefore, ¯ az0 + b

Finally, if  = 0 and  = 0, then the linear function g (z) = z has the only root z0 = 0. Hence it follows from (1.5) (see also (1.10)) that ¯ b F (0) - c F  (0) = 0, ¯ d F (0) - aF  (0) = 0. (1.18)

On a certain functional equation in the algebra of polynomials

2. Functional equations: solubility conditions Given the polynomial (1.2), consider the solubility problem for the functional equation (1.3) with respect to unknown coefficients a, b, c, d and a polynomial f . To treat the above problem, we will use the necessary conditions for the solubility of (1.3) given by (3.1)­(3.8) (depending on whether the root z0 of g (z) satisfies 0 < |z0 | < 1, |z0 | = 1, or z0 = 0). Assume z0 and z1 to be given and consider system (1.16) with respect to unknown a, b, c, d. We will try to find a solution to (1.16) in such a way that (1.3) will have a solution with respect to f . Also, given z0 , we will follow the same way regarding system (1.17). To describe the solubility conditions for the functional equation (1.3), it is convenient to introduce the notion of a regular point. A point z is called regular with respect to the polynomial F if the following conditions are satisfied: F (z ) · F  (z ) = 0 , (n + 1 )

Observe that the notion of a regular point is introduced with respect to the unit circle. It follows immediately from the definition of a regular point that if z0 is regular, then so ¯ is z1 = 1/ z0 and vice versa.

In addition, |A(z)| = 1 for all regular points z, |z| = 1. ¯ Assume that z0 is a regular point of F , A0 = A(z0 ), A1 = 1/ A0 , and 0 , 1 are arbitrary complex numbers. Consider the linear system ¯ ¯ az0 + b = 0 A0 , c + dz0 = 0 , ¯¯ a + bz¯0 = 1 A1 , ¯ cz0 + d = 1 , (2.4)

with unknown a, b, c, and d. It should be pointed out that any solution to system (2.4) is also a solution to (1.16) for z0 = 0, as well as a solution to (1.18) for z0 = 0. For |z0 | < 1 system, (2.4) has the unique solution ¯ a

(2.8)

Let, further, a, b, c, and d be defined by (2.5). Then the functional equation (1.3) admits a solution f (z). Proof. To begin with, consider the case z0 = 0. It follows from (2.8) and (2.6) that  = 0. ¯ Formulae (2.4) and (2.3) provide that z0 and z1 = 1/ z0 are the roots of the polynomial g (z) (1.6): g

On the other hand, the numbers z0 and z1 are the roots of the polynomial ¯¯ G(z) = (az + b)F (z) - (c + dz)F  (z). Therefore, by the Bezout theorem, the rational function f (z ) = G (z ) g (z ) (2.11) (2.10)

is, in fact, a polynomial satisfying the functional equation (1.5). Now the statement of the theorem in the considered case follows from Lemma 1.1. Assume now z0 = 0. The condition (2.8) and equalities (2.6), (2.7) yield  = 0 and  = 0, that is, g (z) = z is a linear function. In addition, z = 0 is a root of the polynomial G(z). Therefore, f (z) = G(z)/ g (z) is a polynomial satisfying (1.5), and again the statement of the theorem in the considered case follows from Lemma 1.1. Aheorem 2.1 is completely proved. T ssume now that a regular point z0 of the polynomial F belongs to the unit circle
|z| = 1. Given numbers c and d , consider system (1.18) with unknown a, b. By solving

(2.16)

If the coefficients a, b, c, and d satisfy relation (2.12), then the functional equation (1.3) has the unique solution (a, b, c, d, f ). Proof. It follows from (1.6) and (2.15)­(3.1) that  = -2z0 = 0. Since the coefficient  2 ¯ ¯ is real and z0 z0 = 1, one obtains the equality  = z0 , that is, g (z)  (z - z0 )2 . At the ¯¯ same time, z0 is a multiple root to the polynomial G(z) = (az + b)F (z) - (c + dz)F  (z). Therefore, the rational function f (z) = G(z)/ g (z) is, in fact, a polynomial satisfying the functional equation (1.5). To complete the proof of Theorem 2.1 it remains to apply C Lemma 1.1. The theorem follows. ombining Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 with property (2) of solutions to (1.3) one can effectively compute the numbers a, b, c, d and the coefficients a0 , a1 , . . . , an of the polynomial f . Indeed, assume, for instance, that z = 0 is a regular point of the polynomial F . Then the regularity condition for the point z = 0 along with condition (2.8) take the form b0 · bn+1 = 0,

(2.17)

also, the equalities (2.6) and (2.7) take the form ¯ ¯ abn+1 = db0 , ¯ ¯ bb0 = cbn+1 . (2.18)

In this case the leading coefficient  of the polynomial g (z), that is determined by a, b, c, d, is equal to zero. Hence, in order to determine unknown coefficients a0 , a1 , . . . , an from system (1.13), one has ¯ ¯ 0 = bb0 - cbn+1 , ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ a0 = ab0 - dbn+1 + bb1 - cbn , ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ak-1 = abk-1 - dbn-k+2 + bbk - cbn-k+1 , k = 2, . . . , n, ¯¯ ¯ ¯ an = abn - db1 + bbn+1 - cb0 , ¯ ¯ 0 = abn+1 - db0 .

(2.19)


E. Muhamadiev 7 Observe that the first and the last equations in (2.19) coincide with (2.18). According to (2.17) and (2.18), one obtains the following relation for the coefficient  of the polynomial g (z ): =

(2.20)

Thus the coefficients a0 , a1 , . . . , an of the polynomial f can be uniquely determined from system (2.19). It follows from Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 that the existence of a regular point for the polynomial F is a sufficient condition for the existence of a solution to the functional equation (1.3). It turns out that the existence of a regular point for the polynomial F is intimately connected to the linear (in)dependence of the polynomials F and F  in the complex linear space of (complex) polynomials. To be more precise, there exists a regular point for F if and only if F and F  are linearly independent. This statement is a direct consequence of the following lemma. Lemma 2.3. The following conditions are equivalent: (a) F and F  are linearly independent in the complex linear space of (complex) polynomials; (b) the identity |F (z)|  |F  (z)| is satisfied; (c) the identity 2 Re is satisfied. Proof. Assume (a) is satisfied: F  = C · F for some nonzero complex number C . Then, according to the definition of the polynomial F  , one has the following equality for the co¯ ¯ efficients b0 , bn+1 : b0 = C bn+1 , bn+1 = C b0 , from which it follows that |C | = 1, and there fore, |F (z)|  |F (z)|. Thus (a) implies (b). Assume, further, |F (z)|  |F  (z)|. Applying to this identity the change of coordinates z = r w, r  0, |w| = 1 and using the definition of F  , one obtains r 2n+2 F

(2.22)

Differentiating the last identity with respect to the real argument r at the point r = 1 we obtain (c). Thus (b) implies (c). Finally, assume that (c) is satisfied and show that F and F  are linearly dependent. Consider the function F (w)/ F (w) on the unit circle |w| = 1, where F (w) = 0, and show that this function has a continuous extension over the unit circle. Assume that F vanishes at some point w0 belonging to the unit circle. Then we have the following representation: F (z) = (z - w0 )k F1 (z), where k  1 is an integer, F1 (w0 ) = 0.

providing the continuity of the function F (w)/ F (w). Differentiating the function wn+1 F (w)/ F (w), w = exp(it ) with respect to t at the points where F (w) = 0 and using condition (c), one obtains d wn+1 F (w) = iw n+1 d t F (w )

(2.25)

The above equality along with the continuity of the function wn+1 F (w)/ F (w) on the unit circle yield that the latter function is, in fact, constant, that is wn+1 F (w) = C · F (w) or, equivalently, F  (w) = C · F (w), |w| = 1. Therefore, the coefficients of the polynomials C · F and F  coincide. The linear dependence of the polynomials F and F  is established 3 and the proof of Lemma 2.3 is complete. . An algorithm for computing the number of roots in the unit circle In what follows we will be interested in the case when the coefficients a, b, c, d satisfy the following additional condition:
|a + bw |  |c + d w |, |w | = 1.

(3.1)

Lemma 3.1. Linear functions a + bz, c + dz satisfy condition (3.1) if and only if the numbers ¯ ¯  = ab - cd,  = |a|2 + |b|2 - |c|2 - |d|2 satisfy the inequality 2||  . Proof. The equality ¯ ¯ |a + bz|2 - |c + d z|2 = |a|2 + 2 (abz) + |b|2 |z|2 - |c|2 - 2 (cd z) - |d |2 |z|2 yields, for z = eit , t  [0, 2 ],
|a + bz|2 - |c + d z|2 =  + 2 eit .

Combining this with the equality min

(3.5)

one obtains the equivalence of conditions (3.1) and (3.2). The lemma is proved.


E. Muhamadiev 9 Observe that Lemma 3.1 allows one to verify effectively the validity of condition (3.1) for the coefficients a, b, c, d determined by regular points of the polynomial F . Lemma 3.2.

Then a, b, c, d satisfy (3.1). The statement following below provides an important property of solution (a, b, c, d, f ) to the functional equation (1.3). Theorem 3.3. Assume that the polynomial F does not contain roots on the unit circle |z| = 1. Suppose, further, that the coefficients a, b, c, d satisfy condition (3.1) and
|ad - bc| +  > 0,

 = |a|2 + |b|2 - |c|2 - |d|2 .

(3.8)

Then the polynomial f as well as any polynomial of the parameterized family G  (z ) = (a + b z ) f (z ) +  (c + d z ) f  (z ), does not contain roots on the unit circle |z| = 1. Proof. Arguing indirectly, one obtains the existence of numbers w, |w| = 1, and   [0, 1] such that G  (w ) = (a + b w ) f (w ) +  (c + d w ) f  (w ) = 0 . ¯ Since ww = 1, one has f  (w ) = w n f from which it follows that (a + b w ) f (w ) +  (c + d w )w n f (w ) = 0 . By condition, G 1 ( w ) = ( a + b w ) f ( w ) + (c + d w ) w n f ( w ) = F ( w ) = 0 , therefore, f (w) = 0 and 0   < 1. Now, using the equality (3.12), we obtain

from which it follows (see Lemma 3.1) that |a + bw| = 0, |c + dw| = 0.

As noted, the computing (F ) maybe a reduction to the generalized Rauss-Hurwitz problem of determining the number of roots of a polynomial in a semiplane (see, for instance, [1­3]). The above results allow us to construct an iterative process for computing (F ), namely, the following theorem. Theorem 3.4.

where G0 (z) = (a + bz) f (z) and the collection (a, b, c, d, f ) satisfying (3.1), (3.8) is a solution to the functional equation (1.3). Proof. Assume the polynomials F and F  to be linearly dependent, that is F  (z)  C F (z). Then the following presentation takes place: F (z) = bn+1 where

From this it follows that the number n + 1 is even and (F ) = 1 + · · · + m = (n + 1 ) . 2 (3.19)

Assume now the polynomials F and F  to be linearly independent. Then, by Lemma 2.3, F admits a regular point z0 , |z0 |  1. Therefore, by Lemmas 1.1, 2.3, and 3.2, there exists a collection (a, b, c, d, f ) satisfying conditions (3.1), (3.8) and being a solution to the functional equation (1.3). Combining Theorem 3.3 and the Rouche theorem one obtains (F ) = (G0 ), where G0 (z) = (a + bz) f (z). I he proof of Theorem 3.4 is complete. T t is easy to see that the number (G0 ) satisfies the equality

Here the coefficients of f can be determined from system (2.19). 4. Criterion for the absence of roots on the unit circle Given the coefficients of the polynomials F and F  , one can construct the following (2n + 2) × (2n + 2) matrix: b0 b  ¯ n+1  0  MF =  0

The matrix MF coincides with the Sylvester matrix of F and F  (up to a permutation of its lines). Therefore, det(MF ) coincides (up to a sign) with the resultant R(F , F  ) of the polynomials F and F  . Let zs , s = 1, . . . , n + 1 be all the roots of F (counted according to their multiplicities). By condition, F (0) = b0 = 0, therefore, all the roots are different ¯- from zero. By definition of the polynomial F  , the numbers zs 1 , s = 1, . . . , n + 1, are roots   of F . Hence (cf. [5]), R(F , F ) can be represented as follows: R

On a certain functional equation in the algebra of polynomials

Theorem 4.1. Let det(MF ) be different from zero. Then F does not have roots on the unit circle |z| = 1. Assume that a collection (a, b, 1, 1, f ) of the numbers a, b, c = d = 1 and a polynomial ¯ f satisfy the functional equation (1.3) and the condition   ab - 1 = 0. Using a, b define the following square matrix of order 2n + 2:

It is easy to see that det(P ) satisfies the following condition: det P = (-1)n-1 n-1

(4.4)

where  = |a|2 + |b|2 - 2. Let M f be a square matrix of order 2n determined by the polynomial f . Using the matrices MF , M f , and P one can express a connection between the coefficients of polynomials F and f , given in system (2.19), by the following matrix equality: b0  0  P MF =  0

Consider the matrix written in the right-hand side of (4.5) more intently: (i) its first and last lines coincide with the corresponding lines of the matrix MF ; (ii) the remaining entries (except for zeros related to the first and the last column) are filled out by the elements of the matrix  · MF . Therefore, equality (4.5) connects det(MF ) and det(M f ) as follows. Theorem 4.2. Let c = d = 1 and assume that the numbers a, b along with coefficients a0 , . . . , an of the polynomial f satisfy (2.19),  = 0. Then one has det MF = (-1)n+1

(5.3)

The following statement reduces the computation of rotation of a plane vector field to the computation of the number of roots in the unit disc of some polynomial. Lemma 5.1. Given a (polynomial) plane vector field , there exists a unique pair (m, F ), where m is an integer and F is a polynomial in complex variable with complex coefficients, F (0) = 0, satisfying the following condition: F (z ) = z m
p

(x , y ) + i q (x , y )

,

z = x + i y , |z| = 1.

(5.4)

Proof. Take a polynomial P (x, y ) = p(x, y ) + iq(x, y ) in real variables x, y . The change of var i ables

determines the rational function in complex variable z:

(5.6)

The function R(z) can be represented in the form R (z ) = F (z ) , zm (5.7)

where F (z) is a polynomial satisfying the condition F (0) = 0 and m is an integer. Since x= 1 + z2 , 2z y= i

z = x + i y , |z| = 1,

(5.8)

the pair (m, F ) satisfies (5.4). To complete the proof of Lemma 5.1, it remains to establish the uniqueness of the pair satisfying (5.4). Suppose that (m1 , F1 ) is another pair satisfying F1 (z) = zm1
p

(x , y ) + i q (x , y )

,

z = x + i y , |z| = 1,

(5.9)

and F1 (0) = 0. Assuming, without loss of generality, that m1  m, one obtains the following equalities for F1 and zm1 -m F : F1 (z) = zm1 P (x, y ) = zm1 -m zm P (x, y ) = zm1 -m F (z) (5.10)

for z = x + i y , |z| = 1. From this it follows that F1 and zm1 -m F coincide. Further, by assumption, F (0) = 0, F1 (0) = 0, hence m1 = m. Thus F1 = F and Lemma 5.1 is completely proved.


E. Muhamadiev 15 Let  and F be as in Lemma 5.1. Then (, S) and (F ) satisfy the following relation: (F ) = m + (, S). (5.11)

(2) Assume a field  to be given in a parametric form: (t ) = { p(t ), q(t )}, where p(t ), q(t ) are real continuous 2 -periodic functions. Suppose (t ) = 0, t  [0, 2 ]. The field  may be considered as the one defined on the unit circle S, by assigning to each point x = cos t , y = sin t the vector { p(t ), q(t )}. Therefore, the rotation (, S) is correctly defined on S. Assuming the functions p(t ), q(t ) to be smooth enough, one can assign to the field  the Fourier series of the complex function P (t ) = p(t ) + iq(t ): P (t ) =

Since the series (5.12) converges uniformly and  does not vanish, there exists an integer N such that for all t  [0, 2 ] the following estimate is true:

Using the same arguments as in Section 1 it is easy to check that (, S) and (F ), where F is defined by (5.14), satisfy (5.11). References
