A. V. GUMINSKAYA AND P. P. ZABREIKO Received 26 June 2005; Accepted 1 July 2005

The paper is devoted to the calculation of the index of a zero and the asymptotic index of a linear completely continuous nonnegative operator. Also the case of a nonlinear completely continuous operator A whose domain and image are situated in a closed convex set Q of a Banach space is considered. For this case, we formulate the rules for calculating the index of an arbitrary fixed point and the asymptotic index under the assumption that the corresponding linearizations exist and the operators of derivative do not have eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1 in some wedges.

Introduction Let Q be a closed convex set in a Banach space and let A : Q  Q be a completely continuous operator. In [4] the calculation problem of a fixed point index of a vector field I - A was formulated. In the simplest case, when Q is a cone, this problem was investigated in the articles by Isaenko [3], Mukhamadiev and Sabirov [5], and Pokornyi [6] (see also references in [8]). Later, in [1, 2] Dancer presented the general formula for the fixed point index of a completely continuous operator A with its domain and image in an arbitrary closed convex set. However, the case of an asymptotic index was not considered. Note that for the case of a cone this problem was earlier considered in the articles by Pokornyi [6] and Pokornyi and Astaf 'eva [7]. The present paper concerns the cases of a wedge and an arbitrary closed convex set. In the latter case, the calculation of a fixed point index is reduced to the index calculation with respect to a specially constructed wedge. We also show that for the infinity singular point one needs to take the wedge W =

On calculation of the relative index

2. Index of a linear operator Let X be a Banach space, W a wedge in X (this means that W is a closed subset of X such that W + W  W and W  W for   0), and A a linear completely continuous operator such that AW  W. (2.1)

Let L = W  (-W ). Then L is the maximal subspace which is contained in W . From (2.1) and the linearity of A it follows that the inclusion A(L)  L (2.2)

holds. Consider a quotient space X/ L and a quotient mapping [·] : X  X/ L. It is easy to check that the image W of W under the quotient mapping [·] is a cone in X/ L. From (2.2) it follows that the operator A induces a linear mapping A of the quotient space X/ L into itself such that A[x] = [Ax]. And by (2.1) we have that the cone W is invariant under the operator A, that is, A is nonnegative in the quotient space X/ L. Theorem 2.1. Let A be a linear completely continuous operator, acting in a Banach space X , and let W be a wedge that is invariant under the operator A. Suppose that Ax = x for x  W , x = 0. Then (A) = 1 and ind(0, I - A; W ) = ind(, I - A; W ) =  0
 (-1)(A|L )

if  < 1, A if  > 1,

A

(2.3)

where A|L is the restriction of the operator A to the space L, (A|L ) is the sum of multiplicities of eigenvalues of A|L , greater than 1, and (A) is the positive spectral radius of the operator A. Proof. If Ax = x for x  W , x = 0, then zero and infinity singular points of the vector field  = I - A are isolated in W . Hence the relative indices ind(0, I - A; W ) and ind(, I - A; W ) are well posed. In this case, by the definition of index at infinity (see, e.g., [4]), since the operator A has no more fixed points in W , it follows that ind(, I - A; W ) = ind(0, I - A; W ). To calculate the index ind(0, ; W ) we will consider two possible cases: when the spectral radius (A) of the operator A is less than 1 and when it is greater than 1. The case (A) = 1 is impossible. Indeed, if this is not true, then there exists an element [x] = 0 of the quotient space X/ L such that A[x] = [x] . In other words, there exist u  W , u  L, and y  L such that the equality u - Au = y holds. Let us explore the solvability in L of (I - A)w = y . If it had a solution w  L, then the vector u - w would be an eigenvector of the operator A, corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 and would be in W , which would contradict our assumptions. If we supposed that the equation had no solutions in L, then the operator I - A would be invertible in L, which is impossible. In the case (A) < 1, let us show that the vector field x = x - Ax is linearly relatively homotopic on SW = {x  W : x = 1} to the field 1 x = x - AQ(x), where Q : X  L is


A. V. Guminskaya and P. P. Zabreiko 3 a projection (in general, nonlinear) of X on L (see [4, Theorem 18.1]). To prove this fact assume the converse, that is, that x = (1 - )Ax + AQx (2.4)

has a solution for some x  SW and   [0, 1]. Now if we rewrite this equation for the operator A and recall (2.2), we get [x] = (1 - )A[x]
[

x]  SW ,   [0, 1]

,

(2.5)

where SW = {[x]  W : [x] = 1}. Under our assumption on the spectral radius of the operator A this yields [x] = 0. In this case, we obtain x = Qx and then (2.4) implies x = Ax for x  SW , which contradicts the assumption of our theorem. Thus the relative index ind(0, I - A; W ) is equal to the relative index ind(0, I - AQ; W ), which actually is the Leray-Schauder zero fixed point index of the restriction A|L of the operator A to the subspace L and we can calculate it by the well-known formula (see, e.g., [4, Theorem 21.1]) ind(0, I - AQ; W ) = (-1)(A|L ) , (2.6)

where (A|L ) is the sum of multiplicities of eigenvalues of A|L , greater than 1. Now assume that (A) > 1. In this case, there exists an element [x] in the cone W such that A[x] = [x] ( > 1). In other words, there exist an element x  L of the wedge W (we assume that x = 1) and an element z of the subspace L such that Ax = x + z. Show that the vector field x = x - Ax is linearly relatively homotopic on SW to the field 2 x = x - cx , where the constant c will be defined later. Let us show that x = (1 - )Ax + cx (2.7)

has no solutions for x  SW ,   [0, 1]. For  = 0, (2.7) coincides with x = Ax. The latter equation has no solutions for x  SW . For 0 <   1 from (2.7), it follows that there exists a real t > 0 such that x  tx . (2.8)

We claim that there exists the maximal of such reals:  = maxxSW , xtx t . We argue by contradiction. The inequality x  x/ t implies that if t tends to infinity, then x  0. On the other hand, x is an element of the wedge W , thus x  0. Hence we get that x  L, which contradicts its choice. Further, (2.7) and (2.8) imply x  (1 -  )  x  +  c x  =
(

1 -  )  +  c

x

.

(2.9)

Choose c >  and observe that for this c the inequality (1 - )  + c >  holds. Indeed, for  = 0 this follows from  > 1. For  = 1 this follows from our assumption for c. For other   (0, 1) the inequality holds as the result of two previous cases.

Therefore for the chosen c, the real  is not maximal among t such that x  t x . This contradiction proves the nondegeneracy of the linear homotopy connecting vector fields  and 2 . Consequently, ind(0, ; W ) = ind(0, 2 ; W ). To calculate ind(0, 2 ; W ) we will use the corollary of the Hahn-Banach theorem. According to it there exists a functional l  X  such that l(W )  0 and l(x ) = 1 (then l  1). Since (2.8), we obtain   l(x)  l for x  SW . And our assumption of c yields c > l  1. Now we can show that the vector field 2 x = x - cx is nondegnerate on clBW = {x  W : x  1}. Indeed,
x - cx  c

1 = c - 1 > 0.

(2.10)

Hence, by the relative rotation property, ind(0, 2 ; W ) = 0. This completes the proof. I n applications there usually exist a complement X1 of the linear hull L(W ) = W - W of the wedge W to X and a complement X2 of a maximal subspace X3 = W  (-W ) in W to L(W ). Then X can be presented as the direct sum of subspaces (see Figure 2.1) X = X1
X2 X3 .

From (2.1) and the linearity of the operator A it follows that the inclusions A

hold. Assume that an intersection W  X2 is not empty. Then it is easy to prove that this set is a cone K in X2 . It generates the order relation in X2 by the following rule: x  y if y - x  K . The cone K can be set as K = {x  X2 : x  0}.


A. V. Guminskaya and P. P. Zabreiko 5 It can be proved that under such decomposition of the space X , the wedge W is invariant under a linear operator A if and only if A is determined by the matrix a11  A = a21 a31

where a22  0. Furthermore, one can show that zero and infinity singular points of such operator A are isolated in W if and only if 1 is not an eigenvalue of the operators a22 and a33 . In this case, Theorem 2.1 can be formulated in the following way. Theorem 2.2. Let A be a linear completely continuous operator, acting in a Banach space X , and let W be a wedge that is invariant under the operator A. Then A can be defined by matrix (2.13). If 1 is not an eigenvalue of the operators a22 and a33 , then zero and infinity singular points of the operator A are isolated in W and ind(0, I - A; W ) = ind(, I - A; W ) =  0

where (a22 ) is the spectral radius of the operator a22 and (a33 ) is the sum of multiplicities of eigenvalues of the operator a33 , greater than 1. 3. Index of a nonlinear operator Let A be a nonlinear operator and let Q be a closed convex set of a Banach space X that is invariant under the operator A. In this part, we discuss the relative fixed point index ´ calculations of A under the assumption that A has a Frechet derivative at its fixed point. Recall that an operator A is called differentiable at the point x0 with respect to Q, if

where A (x0 ) and A () are linear operators. Let Q be an arbitrary closed convex set of a Banach space X . Assume that Q is invariant under a completely continuous operator A. Let x0 be a fixed point of the operator A and ´ let A have a Frechet derivative at the point x0 with respect to Q. The following lemmas show that in the case when the fixed point x0 is not the infinity singular point some wedge Wx0 comprising the set Q is invariant under the mapping of the derivative A (x0 ), whereas in the case of the infinity singular point some wedge W lying in the set Q is invariant under the mapping of derivative A ().

Lemma 3.1. Let A be a completely continuous operator, acting in a Banach space X , and let Q  X be a closed convex set that is invariant under A. Let x0  Q be a fixed point of the operator A and let A have Fr´chet derivative at x0 with respect to Q. Then the wedge e Wx0 = cl

is invariant under the mapping of the derivative A (x0 ). Proof. To prove that Wx0 is actually a wedge it is sufficient to show that Wx0 is closed under addition of its elements and their multiplication by nonnegative reals. If h1 , h2  Wx0 , then h1 = t1 (x1 - x0 ), h2 = t2 (x2 - x0 ), where x1 , x2  Q and 0  t1 , t2 < . Thus for any  and  for which 0  ,  < , and t1 + t2 > 0, we have h1 + h2 = t1

(3.4)

An element t2 t1 x1 + x2 t1 + t2 t1 + t2 (3.5)

is a convex combination of elements x1 , x2  Q and therefore it is in Q. Thus (3.4) implies h1 + h2  Wx0 . If t1 + t2 = 0, then h1 + h2 = 0 and thus h1 + h2  Wx0 . Let h be an arbitrary nonzero element of Wx0 . Then there exist x  Q and t > 0 such that h = t (x - x0 ). From the differentiability of the operator A at x0 and the linearity of the operator A (x0 ) it follows that t

Since A(Q)  Q, the element in the left-hand side of this equality is in Wx0 . Taking the limit as t  , by the closedness of Wx0 , we get A (x0 )h  Wx0 . This completes the proof. L emma 3.2. Let A be a completely continuous operator, acting in a Banach space X , and e let Q  X be a closed convex unbounded set that is invariant under A. Let A have Fr´chet derivative at infinity with respect to Q. Then the wedge W =

 X : x + th  Q x  Q, 0  t <  (

is invariant under the mapping of the derivative A (). Proof. To prove that W is invariant under the operator A (), it suffices to show that there exists an element x  Q such that x + t A ()h  Q for any h  W and 0  t < . Let x  Q, then for any  > 0, t  0, h  W we have x + t h  Q. Since Q is invariant


A. V. Guminskaya and P. P. Zabreiko 7 under the operator A, we get A ()x + t A ()h + w(x + t h)  Q for any   0, t  0, h  W . Then, by the convexity of Q, for any   0 we have

Taking the limit as   , by the closedness of Q, we get x + t A ()h  Q for any t  0, T h  W . This completes the proof. he following theorem specifies the main result of Dancer [2, Theorem 1]. Theorem 3.3. Let A be a completely continuous operator, acting in a Banach space X , and let Q  X be a closed convex set that is invariant under A. Let x0  Q be a fixed point of the operator A and let A have Fr´chet derivative at x0 with respect to Q. Then the wedge e Wx0 = cl

Proof. Without loss of generality it can be assumed that x0 = 0 (in the opposite case, the whole argument needs to be made for the operator A(x0 + x) - x0 ). From the differentiability of the operator A at the point 0 it follows that there exists a linear operator B = A (0) such that Ax = B x + w(x), where the operator w meets the condition

From the convexity of W0 and the invariance of the sets W0 and Q  W0 under operators B and A, respectively, it follows that the element (1 - )Bx + AP x is in W0 for any x  Sr  W0 and   [0, 1].

From the fact that AP has no fixed points beyond Q, it follows that (I - AP , Br  (W0 \ Q); W0 ) = 0. On the other hand, the relative rotation (I - AP , Br  Q; W0 ) can be considered as the rotation (I - A, Br  Q; Q) of the vector field I - A on the boundary of the open set Br  Q with respect to Q. By the definition of relative index, this rotation coiAcides with ind(0, I - A; Q). This completes the proof. n s it appears, the analogous statement is true for the case of asymptotic index.

Since the convexity of Q and the invariance of the sets W  Q and Q under the operators B and A, respectively, it follows that the element (1 - )BP x + Ax is in Q for any x  SR  Q and   [0, 1].

By the definition of relative index and since the operator B has no nonzero fixed points in W , R the latter rotation coincides with ind(0, I - B ; W ). This completes the proof. eferences
