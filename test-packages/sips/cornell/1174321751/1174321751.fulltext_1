A. V. CHERNAVSKY Received 26 June 2005; Accepted 1 July 2005

In this paper we give a complete and improved proof of the "Theorem on the union of two (n - 1)-cells." First time it was proved by the author in the form of reduction to the earlier author's technique. Then the same reduction by the same method was carried out by Kirby. The proof presented here gives a more clear reduction. We also present here the exposition of this technique in application to the given task. Besides, we use a modification of the method, connected with cyclic ramified coverings, that allows us to bypass referring to the engulfing lemma as well as to other multidimensional results, and so the theorem is proved also for spaces of any dimension. Thus, our exposition is complete and does not require references to other works for the needed technique. Copyright © 2006 A. V. Chernavsky.

Notations and statement of the result Specify the standard coordinate system Ox1 · · · xn with the origin O and coordinate axes Oxi in the space Rn . The coordinate planes Ox1 · · · xi will be identified with Ri . The unit disc in Ri is denoted by Bi . The semispaces xn-1  0 and xn-1  0 are denoted as Rn and + n Rn , respectively, while semiplanes Rn  Rn-1 and Rn  Rn-1 as R+-1 and Rn-1 , respec+ - - - n n n tively. Semidiscs B n-1  R+-1 and B n-1  Rn-1 are denoted by B+-1 and B--1 , respectively. - We will say that an embedding q : Bi  M n of an i-disc in a topological n-manifold without boundary is topologically flat if one can extend it to an embedding in M n of its neighborhood in Rn . It is known that a topologically flat embedding of a disc into Rn is extendable to a homeomorphism of Rn onto itself. An embedding of a submanifold is locally flat if every point has a neighborhood in it that is homeomorphic to a disc and the embedding on this disc is topologically flat. Any locally flat embedding of a disc is topologically flat (see, e.g., [8]). Theorem 1.1. Let an embedding q : Bn-1  Rn be given, whose restrictions to both semidiscs n n B+-1 and B--1 are topologically flat. Then q is topologically flat.

Union of flat (n - 1)-cells in Rn

n We will denote the restriction of q onto B±-1 as q± , respectively. Notice an important corollary to this theorem (first time mentioned by Cantrell [1]) that in the case n  4 for embedding of an (n - 1)-manifold into an n-manifold there are no isolated points where the condition of locally flatness is destroyed. If n = 3, it is not the case. The reason for this difference is the fact that for n  4 an isolated singularity cannot exist on the boundary of an (n - 1)-submanifold, and this is derived from the fact that in the former dimensions the arcs with only one singularity do not exist, (see [5, 6]) while it is well known that in the dimension 3 they do exist. The proof of this theorem is based on a series of lemmas using the constructions of some elementary homeomorphisms described in Section 2. Here we introduce some notations. Denote by  the semiplane, bounded by subspace Rn-2 and having the angle of  n radians with R+-1 = 0 . (- =  = Rn-1 .) Q[, ],  <  will denote a closed domain - between  and  (Q[, ] =   ), Q(, ) denotes the interior of Q[, ]. For a point z  Rn we denote by xz its projection onto Rn-2 and by yz its projection onto Rn-1 . Consider the system of 2-planes Px , x  Rn-2 orthogonal to Rn-2 at the corresponding points x. Consider also in every plane Px an orthonormal coordinate system with the origin x and axes xs and xt , the former is parallel and codirected with the axe Oxn-1 , and the latter is parallel and codirected with the axe Oxn , s and t have the meaning of coordinate parameters. For a point z  Rn we denote by sz and tz its coordinates in the plane Pxz . At last, Cx (r ) will denote a circle with the radius r in the plane Px centred at x. For a point z  Rn we denote by rz its distance from Rn-2 , that is, the radius r of a circle Cxz (r ) passing through z.

2. Preliminar y statements The following two statements will help us to construct some elementary homeomorphisms of Rn that send every circle Cx (r ) onto itself piecewise linearly. Statement 2.1. Let for some  a closed subset M  Rn be given such that in some neighborhood of B n-2 it does not intersect  \ Rn-2 and lies on one side of  (i.e., in Q(,  +  ) or in Q( -  , )). Then there exists a function (z) > 0, z   \ Rn-2 (possibly in a smaller neighborhood of B n-2 ), that is continuous, tending to zero as z is tending to a point in Rn-2 , and such that for any circle Cx (r ) in this neighborhood its arc with the length (z), having an end in z   and lying on one side of  as M , does not intersect M . The construction of (z) is standard and evident, so that it may be omitted. For z   consider arcs of the circles Cxz (rz ) having one end at z and the length (z), where this function is chosen according to Statement 2.1 for some set M , the arcs are taken on one side of  , as M . The surface, described by the second ends of these arcs (i.e., not on  ) will be called the fence separating M from  . Note that every circle Cx (sufficiently close to Bn-2 ) intersects every  and every fence exactly one time.


A. V. Chernavsky 3 Statement 2.2. Let four sets A, B , C , D in a neighborhood of Bn-2 be given so that each of them is either a  or a fence, and the points of intersections of B and C with any circle Cx (r ) in this neighborhood are located between points of intersection of this circle with the sets A and D. Then there exists a homeomorphism of Rn , identical outside a neighborhood of Bn-2 and outside the domain between A and D (containing B and C ), that sends B into C in a smaller neighborhood. For the proof it is sufficient to construct a homeomorphism on every circle Cx (r ) in a small neighborhood of Bn-2 that maps linearly the arc between A and B into the arc between A and C and simultaneously the arc between B and D into the arc between C and D, such that it is identical on the second arc between A and D. In some larger neighborhood one can continuously reduce this homeomorphism to the identity. The homeomorphisms constructed as in this proof will be called arcwise. Note that arcwise homeomorphisms are naturally isotopic to the identity. Before turning to our lemmas, let us introduce the following definitions. Defintions 2.3. An embedding  :   Rn , being identity on Rn-2 , touches  at points of B n-2 if for every  > 0 one can find  > 0 so that   O (Bn-2 )  Q[ - ,  + ]. Analogously, a sequence of points zn  Rn touches  at a point x  Bn-2 if for every  > 0 there exists n such that zn  Q[ - ,  + ]  O (x) for all n > n . 3. Lemmas
n Lemma 3.1. Let an embedding p1 : B n \ (B--1 \ B n-2 )  Rn be identical on Bn-2 , and for n every   [- +  / 4,  -  / 4] the set p1 ( ) touches  . Let also p1 B+-1  Rn . + n n Then the cell B--1  p1 B+-1 is embedded topologically flat, that is, there is a homen n ¯ omorphism p1 of Rn that maps Bn-1 onto B--1  p1 B+-1 . (The tangency of  for   Q(- / 2, + / 2) is not essential and has only a technical role.) n Proof. First we will construct a mapping w : Rn  Rn , that orthogonally projects B--1 n onto Bn-2 , is homeomorphic outside B--1 , and is identical on Rn . Under the given con+ n ditions it is clear that the composition w-1  w coincides with p1 on B+-1 . At the same n -1 . T h e o b t a i n e d time it occurs that this composition can be extended identically on B- ¯ extension is the homeomorphism p1 we are looking for. The beginning of this construction of w is determined by the requirements that w = 1 n on Rn and w( y ) = x y for y  B--1 . Extend w identically to the points y  Rn-1 whose - + n-2 are situated outside B n-2 . If x  B n-2 and y  Rn-1 \ B n-1 , we projections x y onto R y - - take as w( y ) the point that is obtained from y by the shift along the direction of the axe n Oxn-1 in the distance equal to the intersection segment of B--1 with the axe x y s in Px y . Thus we have constructed w on the space Rn-1 . For every point y  Rn-1 , we denote by L y the straight line going through y and being - parallel to the axe Oxn . If x y lies outside Bn-2 , set w = 1 on L y . Let y  Bn-1 . Define that w sends L y isometrically into the union of two rays in Px y starting at the point x y  B n-2 with the angle  = ±( / 2 -  / 4 · s y ) with respect to the axe x y s (s y < 0 is the coordinate of y in Px y ). Notice that    / 2, when s y  0, that is, y  x y .

If x y  B n-2 and y  Rn-1 \ B n-1 , then w sends L y isomorphically to the pair of rays - in Px y starting at the point w( y ) with the angles  = ±( / 2 -  / 4 · s y ), where y is an intersection of the half-axe x y s  Rn with the boundary of Bn-1 . - Now w is well posed on the entire Rn ; it is continuous and identical on Rn and outside + n xBn-2 Px . Also w retracts B--1 onto B n-2 by the orthogonal projection and it is homeon morphic outside B--1 . n It remains to note that a sequence of points zn tends to a point y  B--1 if and only if w( yn ) tends to x y , touching   - , where  is chosen according to the point y as above, that is,  y = ±( / 2 -  / 4 · s y ). Indeed, take a spherical neighborhood V with radius  > 0 of a point x y in the plane xn-1 = 0 and consider the set W of points z  Rn that are projected to V . Let U ( y ) be - the intersection of W with the domain between two planes, being parallel to xn-1 = 0 and located on different sides of y in the distance . Let U (x y ) be the intersection of W with Q( y -  / 2 · ,  y +  / 2 · )  Q(- y -  / 2 · , - y +  / 2 · ). Then for every  > 0 one can find a  > 0 such that w(U ( y ))  U , and, conversely, for every  > 0 one can find a  such that w(U ( y ))  U (x y ). Hence the sequence of points zn  Rn tends to n y  I nt B--1 if and only if w(zn ) tends to x y and touches  y  - y . n A sequence zn tends to y  B--1 \ B n-2 if and only if wzn  x y and for every  > 0 there exists n0 such that for n > n0 all zn are located outside Q(- / 2 -  / 4 + , + / 2 +  / 4 - ). It is clear that the same property is fulfilled for the sequence hw(zn ). n This proves that the homeomorphism p1 = w-1 p1 w is extended identically to B--1 , as what was in demand. The constructed homeomorphism p1 coincides with the given p1 n n n n ¯ on B+-1 and is identical on B+-1 . Thus, the union of cells B--1  p1 B+-1 = p1 B n is emn-1 \ B n-2 . But then one can easily construct bedded locally flat at least at the points of B n n n a homeomorphism of the whole space that sends B--1  p1 B+-1 into B--1 . It is a standard n n construction (see [3]), which we leave as an exercise. So, the embedding of B--1  p1 B+-1 L is topologically flat. emma 3.2. The assertion of Lemma 3.1 is true for the embedding p2 : Q[- / 2,  / 2]  n Q[- / 2,  / 2], for which p2  touches  with   (- / 2,  / 2), p2 B+-1  Q(- / 4,  / 4). Proof. Construct the arc homeomorphism  : Q[- ,  ]  Q[- / 2,  / 2], identical on Q[- / 4,  / 4], that sends linearly the arc of each circle Cx (r ) between the points of its intersections with  and  /4 to the arc between its intersections with  /2 ,  /4 , and, analogously, sends the arc between - and - /4 to the arc between  /2 and - /4 . It is clear that touching  is transformed into touching  . Then, the hypothesis of n Lemma 3.1 is satisfied for -1 p2  that coincides with p2 on B+-2 . Thus, the embedding n-1  p B n-2 is topologically flat. L of the cell B- 2+ emma 3.3. Let an embedding p3 : Rn  Rn be given in some neighborhood of Bn-2 , where + + the images of - /2 ,  /2 , and two more semiplanes  , - / 2 <  <  / 2 (let them be for definiteness - /4 and 0 ) touch their preimages: - /2 ,  /2 , - /4 , 0 at the points of B n -2 . Then there exists an isotopy t : Rn  Rn , identical outside p3 Rn and outside a given + ¯ neighborhood of B n-2 , such that 0 = 1 and p3  = 1 p3  touches  at the points of Bn-2 ¯ for all   [- / 2,  / 2]. In particular, the condition of Lemma 3.2 for p2 is fulfilled for p3 .


A. V. Chernavsky 5 Proof. At first note that if the hypothesis of touching is fulfilled for some dense set of   [- / 2,  / 2], it will be fulfilled for all  from this interval. So, we will try to obtain its fulfillment for a countable dense set of values, namely for the set { =  d}, where d is a dyadic rational and |d|  1/ 2. Enumerate these numbers into a sequence k (starting with the four given values of ), and begin constructing a countable sequence of k -isotopies (k) , each of which is identical on the k -neighborhood of Bn-2 and achieves the touching condition for the homeomorphism (k) · · · (1) p3 at the points of Bn-2 for every next k without loosing this property for the preceding i . In this construction, independently from the preceding steps, one may take the numbers k arbitrarily small. Hence the sequence of isotopies t(k) · · · t(1) will tend to an isotopy, and in the limit the touching condition will be fulfilled for all   [- / 2,  / 2]. It is sufficient to describe one step of the construction, say, for values of  given in the lemma. Next steps are absolutely analogous. Let us show how to obtain this touching condition for  =  / 4. The construction of S the isotopy in demand takes several steps. tep 1. Note that by applying the arcwise homeomorphisms one can get that the images of  touch  on one side; for example, that p3 0 touches 0 and lies in Q(0,  / 2), and p3 - /4 touches - /4 and lies in Q(- / 4, 0). (Certainly, it is sufficient for each touching condition to be fullfilled in a small neighborhood of Bn-2 .) Let us show this for p3 0 . Note that 3 /8 and  /4 lie in a small neighborhood of Bn-2 between p3  /2 and p3 0 and do not intersect them except for Rn-2 . Construct an arcwise homeomorphism  , identical outside Q(0, 3 / 8), that sends  /4 to the fence S0 touching 0 . Replace p3 by p3 =  p3 . All the hypotheses of the lemma remain true, but now p3 0 lies between the fence S0 and - /16 (in a small neighborhood of Bn-2 ), since p3 0 touches 0 . Construct now an arcwise homeomorphism  , identical outside the domain in Rn + bounded by S0 and - /8 , that sends  /16 to 0 . The lemma's hypotheses remain true   after replacing p3 by p3 =  p3 , but then p3 0 lies between 0 and S0 , that is, on one side of 0 . Thus from the very beginning we may suppose that p3 0 lies in Q(0,  / 4) and touches 0 as well as, analogously, that p3 - /4  Q(- / 4, 0) and touches - /2 . Moreover, p3  /2  Q( / 4,  / 2) and touches  /2 as well as p3 - /2  Q(- / 2, - / 4) and touches - /2 . Step 2. Construct an arcwise homeomorphism 1 , identical outside Q(0,  / 2), that sends -  /4 to the fence S1 touching 0 , closely to 0 so that p3 S1  Q(0,  / 4). Let t1 = p3 1 p3 1 . 3 Then t1 = 1 outside p3 Q(0,  / 2) and t1 p3  /4  Q(0,  / 4). Let p = t1 p3 . Step 3. Construct now a fence S2 touching - /4 closely so that p3 S2 lies in Q(- / 4, 0). Let 2 be an arcwise homeomorphism identical outside Q(- / 4,  / 4) that sends 0 to S2 . Let t2 = p3 2 p3-1 . Then t2 = 1 outside p3 Q(- / 4,  / 4), t2 p3 0  Q(- / 4, 0), and t2 p3  /4  Q(0,  / 4). Let p3 = t2 p3 .

Step 4. Construct a fence S2 that touches 0 and separates 0 from p3  /4 . Construct also another fence S2 touching  /4 and lying in Q(0,  / 4). Let 3 be an arcwise homeomorphism, identical outside of Q(0,  / 4), that sends S2 to S2 . Then p3 = 3 p3  /4 lies in the domain between  /4 and S2 , that is, it touches  /4 on one side.
- - ¯ Step 5. Consider now the homeomorphism p3 = t2 1 3 = t2 1 3 t2 t1 p3 . It is clear that ¯ ¯ p3 = p3 on - /2   /2  - /4  0 and that p3  /4 touches  /4 on one side. Since - ¯ p3 · p3 1 is identical on - /2   /2 , there is an isotopy t , identical outside Q(- / 2,  / 2) ¯- ¯ and such that 0 = 1, 1 = p3 p3 1 , that is, p3 = 1 p3 . It is clear that one can make this isotopy -small and identical outside the -neighborhood of Bn-2 for any given . All conditions of the lemma are satisfied.

Lemma 3.4. Let a homeomorphism p4 : Rn  Rn be identical on Rn-2 such that p4 Qk  Qk , 0  k  3 where Q0 = Q[- / 8,  / 8] and Qi , 1  i  3 are obtained from Q0 by consecutive turns by 90 counter-clockwise (from xn-1 to xn ). Then for every  > 0 there exists a -isotopy t : Rn  Rn , identical on Rn-2 and outside a given neighborhood of Bn-2 , and such that in a smaller neighborhood of Bn-2 the homeo¯ morphism p4 = 1 p4 , restricted to Rn , fulfills the conditions of Lemma 3.3 for p3 . + The proof of this lemma follows form an evident construction with arcwise homeomorphisms. First of all, one may assume, as in the proof of the preceding lemma, that in a neighborhood of B n-2 the images of k for k = k / 2, 0  k  3 touch k at points of Bn-2 and on the wishful side of k . Indeed, let ± /4 and ±3 /4 remain immovable. Move the semiplanes + /8 and - /8 by an arcwise homeomorphism 0 , that is identical outside Q[- / 4,  / 4], to 0 and to a fence S0 that touches 0 , respectively. By the same way, let an arcwise homeomorphism 1 , identical outside Q[ / 4, 3 / 4], move the semiplane  /2+ /8 to  /2 and  /2- /8 to a fence S1 touching  /2 . Let 2 be an arcwise homeomorphism, identical outside Q[3 / 4, 5 / 4], that sends - - /8 to - and - + /8 to a fence S2 touching - . At last, let 3 be an arcwise homeomorphism that is identical outside Q[-3 / 4, - / 4] and sends - /2- /8 and - /2+ /8 to - /2 and to a fence S3 touching - /2 , respectively. Let  be a homeomorphism that in each fourth-space, limited by semiplanes ± /4 and ±3 /4 , coincides with the corresponding k , 0  k  3. Construct an arcwise homeomorphism  : Rn  Rn that sends the domain between  and S2 to the domain between - /2 and S3 as well as the domain between - /2 and S3 to the domain between - /4 and a fence touching - /4 . Also, let  = 1 in Q[- / 8,  -  / 8] and on ± /4  ±3 /4 . ¯ ¯+ It is clear that p4 =   p4 satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 3.3 for p3 . Namely, p4 Rn  n, p  ¯ ¯ ¯ R+ ¯4 ± /2 touches ± /2 , p4 0 touches 0 , and p4 - /4 touches - /4 ; also, p4 is isotopic to p4 by a small isotopy, since an arcwise homeomorphism is isotopic to the identity and its mesh does not supersede diameters of circles Cx (r ) and of their images on which it is not identical. It should be pointed out that the homeomorphism  , constructed above, is identical on  /2+ /4 .


A. V. Chernavsky 7 Lemma 3.5. Assume that there exists a homeomorphism p5 : Rn  Rn such that p5 Q[- / 8,  / 8]  Q(- / 8,  / 8). There is an isotopy t : Rn  Rn , identical on Rn-2 and outside a neighborhood of Bn-2 , ¯ such that 0 = 1 and 1 p5 = p5 satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 3.4 for p4 and coincides n -1  p B n -1 . with p5 on B- 5+
n Proof. Consider the 4-sheeted covering  : Rn  Rn , branched over the subspace R1 -2  2 1 n R1 . (It is convenient to indicate distinction between the same objects in the domain and in the image spaces of the covering  by means of lower indices.) Denote by j : Rn  Rn 2 1 the natural identification of both spaces. Let us concretize the covering by identifying n every plane Pkx  Rn , where x  Rk -2 , k = 1, 2, with the complex line C1 (xs is the real i and xt is the imaginary axes), and by representing  as the function z  ei·3z z, where n- z = z eiz . Here j =  on R2+ 1 . According to the hypothesis of Lemma 3.4 the homeomorphism p5 : Rn  Rn is given. 1 1 Consider the homeomorphism p5 : Rn  Rn , covering p5 ( p5 = p5 ). We have  p5 = p5 j 2 2 n- on R2+ 1 . Construct now a homeomorphism  : Rn  Rn , patching up the covering p so that 2 2  = j on Q2 [- / 8,  / 8]. Namely,  is an arcwise homeomorphism, identical on Q2 [- / 4,  / 4], that sends Q2 [- / 8,  / 8] into Q2 [- / 32,  / 32]. (One may analogously redefine  on other three quadrants, separated by planes xn = ±xn-1 , so that the mapping would remain a covering, but it is not important for us.) ¯ As a result, -1 = j on Q2 [- / 8,  / 8]. The homeomorphism p5 : Rn  Rn , defined by 1 1 ¯ equality p5 = j -1 p5  j -1 , coincides on Q1 [- / 8,  / 8] with p5 = -1 -1 p5 -1 -1 . Moreover,

¯ p5 Q1 [-k / 8, k / 8]  Q1 [-k / 8, k / 8],

0  k  3.

(3.1)

¯ So, p5 satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 3.4 for the homeomorphism p4 , as what is required. ¯ Besides, p5 is isotopic to the homeomorphism p5 under isotopy that is identical on ¯- 4n R1 -2 , since p5 p5 1 is identical on Q1 [- / 8,  / 8]. . Proof of the theorem Since the embedding q- is topologically flat, it can be extended to a homeomorphism n of Rn and so we can assume that q is identical on B--1 . Construct two fences S- and n S on two different sides of B--1 , that are touching Rn-1 from above and from below n n and separating B--1 from qB+-1 . Then move them by an arcwise homeomorphism  , n-1 , onto  identical on B- - / 8 and onto  / 8 , respectively, and replace q with q =  q . We n obtain qB+-1  Q(- / 8,  / 8). Suppose that this is valid for q from the very beginning. Since q+ is topologically flat, it can be extended to a homeomorphism h : Rn  Rn n n n n (h|B+-1 = q|B+-1  Q(- / 8, + / 8)  Rn ). As hB+-1  B--1 = B n-2 , applying as well as + n-1 , one can wangle hQ[- / 2,  / 2]  above the arcwise homeomorphisms, identical on B- Q(- / 2,  / 2).

Union of flat (n - 1)-cells in Rn Thus the assertion of our theorem now takes the following form.

n Theorem 4.1. Suppose that there is a homeomorphism h : Rn  Rn , for which hB+-1  n-1  hB n-1 is topologically flat. More precisely: there exists a Q(- / 8,  / 8). Then the cell B- + n n ¯ homeomorphism h : Rn  Rn , identical on B--1 , that coincides with h on B+-1 .

The proof of this statement follows from the above sequence of lemmas as follows: First, having constructed an arcwise homeomorphism , identical on Rn , that sends - - /8 and  /8 , respectively, to fences S- and S+ , touching 0 from below and from above and separating 0 from h-1 - /8 and h-1  /8 , we may replace h by a homeomorphism n h that coincides with h on B+-1 and moves Q[- / 8,  / 8] into Q(- / 8,  / 8). Then we obtain a homeomorphism satisfying the hypotheses of Lemma 3.5 for p5 . n By Lemma 3.5 we obtain a homeomorphism that coincides with the given h on B+-1 and satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma 3.4 for the homeomorphism p4 . By Lemma 3.4 we ¯ can construct a homeomorphism p4 that satisfies the condition for p3 from Lemma 3.3, is isotopic to p4 , and is identical on 3 /4 by its construction. Denote by D the semiball in 3 /4 , bounded by Bn-2 , and by  the arcwise homeomorn n phism, constructed in Lemma 3.4, that is identical on D. Evidently, the cell B--1  hB+-1 n-1 , if and only if it is topologically flat if and only if the same is true for the cell D  hB+ n n n is so for D  hB+-1 , and if and only if it is so for B--1  hB+-1 , because these cells are obtained one from another by the application of some (arcwise) homeomorphisms of the space. n n So, it is sufficient to prove that the cell B--1  p3 B+-1 is topologically flat, where p3 is the embedding given in Lemma 3.3. According to Lemma 3.3 we can replace p3 by an embedding, isotopic to p3 under the n isotopy, identical on B--1 , that satisfies the conditions of Lemma 3.2. This isotopy sends n-1  p B n-1 to the cell B n-1  p B n-1 = B n-1  p B n-1 and we have to prove ¯3 + the cell B- 3+ 2+ - - that the latter is locally flat. But this is the assertion of Lemma 3.2. The theorem follows. Acknowledgment The work was supported by Grant 03-01-00705 from RFBR. References
