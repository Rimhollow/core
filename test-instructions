There are two kinds of tests in this repository:

Unit tests for:
 - workspace related code (aip, wip, sip classes and depenencies)
 - daitss libraries (authentication, operations database)
 
Cucumber features for integration testing

Cucumber features require the following to work properly:

 - $CONFIG set equal to path of config.yml. For more information on config.yml, look at config.example.yml.
 - $WORKSPACE set to a valid path.
 - Running test stack. This is the required set of DAITSS web services. The test stack is started with "rake services:run"
 - Database initialization. This creates the tables for the aip store and operations datasets. The database is initalized with "rake database:db_migrate"
